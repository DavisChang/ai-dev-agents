# Project Profile — Auto-generated by Bootstrap Agent (01-bootstrap-context)
# =============================================================================
# This file is the adaptive foundation for all AI agents. It describes the
# project's tech stack, structure, and tooling so agents can dynamically
# adapt their behavior to any project type.
#
# Most fields are auto-detected by the Bootstrap Agent. Fields marked with
# "# TODO" or "# HUMAN:" require human verification or input.
